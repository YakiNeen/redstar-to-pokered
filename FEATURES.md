   - Holding B will let you walk through walls ("noclip") including out of bounds
   - "Debug" will, in addition the the "Noclip" features, give you a strong party, seven badges, some good items, ¥999,999, and skip the introductory game events
- Fixed some [bugs in Red and Blue](https://forums.glitchcity.info/index.php?topic=7682.0):

   - Blaine may use a Super Potion with his Pokémon at full health

- Default text speed is fast
- Shiny icons in battle, in case you don't notice the sparkle animation
- MissingNo has *not* been "fixed"; its Pokédex entry is the Space World placeholder one

There are *no* new Pokémon, maps, moves, or items (except the Heart Stone). This may look like Space World, but its content is purely R/B/Y.


### Higher shiny odds

If you want nearly 2% of wild Pokémon to be shiny like in the Space World demo, then follow the instructions in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to build your own ROM—but before running `make`, edit [engine/shiny.asm](engine/shiny.asm), replacing this:

```
IsMonShiny:
	ld h, d
	ld l, e
	ld a, [hli]
	bit 5, a
	jr z, .notShiny
	and a, $f
	cp 10
	jr nz, .notShiny
	ld a, [hl]
	cp (10 << 4) | 10
	jr nz, .notShiny
	and a
	ret

.notShiny
	xor a
	ret
```

with this:


```
IsMonShiny:
	ld h, d
	ld l, e
	; attack DV >= 10?
	ld a, [hl]
	and $f0
	cp 10 << 4
	jr c, .notShiny
	; defense DV >= 10?
	ld a, [hli]
	and $f
	cp 10
	jr c, .notShiny
	; speed DV >= 10?
	ld a, [hl]
	and $f0
	cp 10 << 4
	jr c, .notShiny
	; special DV >= 10?
	ld a, [hl]
	and $f
	cp 10
	jr c, .notShiny
	and a
	ret

.notShiny
	xor a
	ret
```

Now any Pokémon with all four DVs at 10 or above (out of 15) will be shiny.
